\title{Convert an effect measure}
\usage{
toRR(est, rare, delta = 1, ...)

toMD(est, delta = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{est}{The effect estimate; constructed with one of \code{\link[=RR]{RR()}}, \code{\link[=OR]{OR()}}, \code{\link[=HR]{HR()}},
\code{\link[=MD]{MD()}}, \code{\link[=OLS]{OLS()}}.}

\item{rare}{When converting a \code{\link[=OR]{OR()}} or \code{\link[=HR]{HR()}} estimate, a logical indicating
whether the outcome is sufficiently rare to approximate a risk ratio.}

\item{delta}{When converting an \code{\link[=OLS]{OLS()}} estimate, the contrast of interest
in the exposure. Defaults to 1 (a 1-unit contrast in the exposure).}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to other methods.}
}
\value{
An object of class "estimate" and the desired effect measure. Also
includes as an attribute its conversion history.
}
\description{
These helper functions are mostly used internally to convert
\link[=effect_measures]{effect measures} for the calculation of E-values. The
approximate conversion of odds and hazard ratios to risk ratios depends on
whether the rare outcome assumption is made.
}
\details{
Uses the conversions listed in Table 2 of VanderWeele TJ, Ding P.
\emph{Sensitivity Analysis in Observational Research: Introducing the E-Value.}
Annals of Internal Medicine. 2017;167(4):268â€“75.

See references.

Regarding the continuous outcome, the function uses the effect-size
conversions in Chinn (2000) and VanderWeele (2017) to approximately convert
the mean difference between these exposure "groups" to the odds ratio that
would arise from dichotomizing the continuous outcome.

\examples{
# Both odds ratios are 3, but will be treated differently
# depending on whether rare outcome assumption is reasonable
OR(3, rare = FALSE)
OR(3, rare = TRUE)
toRR(OR(3, rare = FALSE))
toRR(OR(3, rare = TRUE))
attributes(toRR(toMD(OLS(3, sd = 1.2), delta = 1)))
