\arguments{
\item{type}{\code{dist} for distribution plot; \code{line} for line plot (see Details)}

\item{q}{True effect size that is the threshold for "scientific significance"}

\item{muB}{Single mean bias factor on log scale (only needed for distribution plot)}

\item{Bmin}{Lower limit of lower X-axis on the log scale (only needed for line plot)}

\item{Bmax}{Upper limit of lower X-axis on the log scale (only needed for line plot)}

\item{sigB}{Standard deviation of log bias factor across studies (length 1)}

\item{yr}{Pooled point estimate (on log scale) from confounded meta-analysis}

\item{vyr}{Estimated variance of pooled point estimate from confounded meta-analysis}

\item{t2}{Estimated heterogeneity (tau^2) from confounded meta-analysis}

\item{vt2}{Estimated variance of tau^2 from confounded meta-analysis}

\item{breaks.x1}{Breaks for lower X-axis (bias factor) on RR scale (optional for line plot; not used for distribution plot)}

\item{breaks.x2}{Breaks for upper X-axis (confounding strength) on RR scale (optional for line plot; not used for distribution plot)}

\item{CI.level}{Pointwise confidence level as a proportion}
}
\description{
Produces line plots (\code{type="line"}) showing the bias factor on the relative risk (RR) scale vs. the proportion
of studies with true RRs above \code{q} (or below it for an apparently preventive relative risk).
The plot secondarily includes a X-axis scaled based on the minimum strength of confounding
to produce the given bias factor. The shaded region represents a 95\% pointwise confidence band.
Alternatively, produces distribution plots (\code{type="dist"}) for a specific bias factor showing the observed and
true distributions of RRs with a red line marking exp(\code{q}).
}
\details{
Arguments \code{vyr} and \code{vt2} can be left \code{NA}, in which case no confidence
band will appear on the line plot.

\examples{
# with variable bias and with confidence band
sens_plot( type="line", q=log(1.1), Bmin=log(1), Bmax=log(4), sigB=0.1,
           yr=log(1.3), vyr=0.005, t2=0.4, vt2=0.03 )

# with fixed bias and without confidence band
sens_plot( type="line", q=log(1.1), Bmin=log(1), Bmax=log(4),
           yr=log(1.3), t2=0.4 )

# apparently preventive
sens_plot( type="line", q=log(0.90), Bmin=log(1), Bmax=log(4),
           yr=log(0.6), vyr=0.005, t2=0.4, vt2=0.04 )

# distribution plot: apparently causative
# commented out because takes 5-10 seconds to run
# sens_plot( type="dist", q=log(1.1), muB=log(2),
#           yr=log(1.3), t2=0.4 )
           
# distribution plot: apparently preventive
# commented out because takes 5-10 seconds to run
# sens_plot( type="dist", q=log(0.90), muB=log(1.5),
#           yr=log(0.7), t2=0.2 )
